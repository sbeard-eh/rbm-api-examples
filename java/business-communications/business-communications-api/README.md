# Business Communications API - Java

RCS for Business uses the
[Business Communications API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/reference/business-communications/rest)
for two separate sets of operations:

-   For developers: to create RCS for Business agents, manage assets and submit
    agents for approval. These are known as
    [RBM Management API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/management-api/overview)
    functions.
-   For carriers: to approve, reject and suspend RCS for Business agents
    submitted to their network. These are know as
    [RBM Operations API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/carriers/operations-api/get-started)
    features.
